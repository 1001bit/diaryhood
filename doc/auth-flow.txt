1. Requesting For Email:
    User POST Requests /login/email with Login(either username or email) field in body
        Gateway handles it with LoginEmailHandler handler
        Gateway sends gRPC SendOTPEmail request with Login field to Auth service
            Auth service sends gRPC GetEmailAndUsernameByLogin request to User service Email
                User service gets Email and Username from database and responds with it
            Auth service generates OTP and stores it in Otp-redis
            Auth service sends OTP and Username via Email service
            Auth service responds with Email to Gateway service
        Gateway service responds with Email to User
    User stores the Email in local variable

2. Entering the OTP From email:
    User POST Requests /login/otp with Email and OTP fields in body
        Gateway handles it with LoginOTPHandler handler 
        Gateway sends gRPC VerifyOTP request with Login and OTP fields to Auth service
            Auth service verifies if Email and OTP pair are in Otp-redis
            Auth service sends Login request with Email field to User service
                User service either creates new user or does nothing (returns username in both cases)
            Auth service generates Access JWT with Username
            Auth service generates Refresh UUID and stores it in Refresh-redis
            Auth service responds with AT and returns
        Gateway service sets cookies with RT and AT

3. Refreshing tokens:
    User GET Requests /auth/refresh with Refresh token
        Gateway handles it with RefreshHandler
        Gateway sends gRPC Refresh request with Refresh field to Auth service
            Auth service verifies Refresh UUID, generates new one and now has Username and new UUID
            Auth service generates new Access JWT with username
            Auth service responds with both new tokens
        Gateway sets new tokens in cookies
