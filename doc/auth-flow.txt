            User service gets Email and Username by Login (from request) via Database
            User service generates OTP and creates Email-OTP pair in Otp-redis
            User service makes gRPC request to email service to send OTP+username to email
            User service responds with Email
        Gateway sets Email as a cookie

            User service verifies Email-OTP pair in Otp-redis
            User service gets UserID and Username by Email from Database
            User service generates RefreshUUID-UserID pair in Refresh-redis
            User service generates AccessJWT with Username

3. Refreshing tokens:
    User GET Requests /auth/refresh with Refresh token
        Gateway handles it with RefreshHandler
        Gateway sends RefreshTokens gRPC request to User service with RefeshUUID field
